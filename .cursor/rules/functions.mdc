## Guidelines
- standard return format: `{"success": bool, "message": str, "result": dict}`.
- please follow example function [example_function.py](mdc:example_function.py)
- unless dealing with external services functions should assume correct parameters will be passed to it.

## Function Design
- Assume all params are passed in correctly. Dont handle exceptions until its determined to be nessary to meet project goals.
- Early return pattern used for validation with clear error messages.
- Exception handling with try-except only when dealing with external services.
- Detailed documentation with docstrings including parameter and return descriptions.
- Functions should be stored in ./src/functions.
- One function per a file. The name of the function should match the file name.

When creating a function:
- [ ] `grep_search` for existing functions before a creating new one.
- [ ] `grep_search` for existing functions that could potentially be leveaged.
