# General Guidelines, 

- FAIL FAST: Avoid try and except blocks unless told otherwise

- LESS IS MORE: Be mininalistic. Always aim for minimal viable solution. Dont implement more code then is needed.

- ITERATE, ITERATE AND ITERATE: We are iteratively coding, not trying to one shot prompt.

- SIMPLE IS BETTER THAN COMPLEX: Start of with the simplest possible implementation. We can always iterate and add more complexity if its needed.

- MVP TESTING ONLY: Dont create tests for things that havn't happened yet

## Function Design
- All functions follow a standard return format: `{"success": bool, "message": str, "result": dict}`.
- Early return pattern used for validation with clear error messages.
- Exception handling with try-except only when dealing with external services.
- Detailed documentation with docstrings including parameter and return descriptions.
- Standalone executable main section with example usage in each function file.
- Functions should be stored in ./src/functions.
- One function per a file. The name of the function should match the file name.
